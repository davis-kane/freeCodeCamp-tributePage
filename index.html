    By September, Andrew Henry arrives at the mouth of Yellowstone River and builds a fort. Jim Bridger is still with Henry.  William Ashley arrives on Oct 1st with supplies and returns immediately to St. Louis.  Jedediah Smith arrives with Ashley, but stays at the fort.­</li>

    Fifteen Ashley men are killed at the Arikara villages including John S. Gardner.  Jedediah Smith and John Fitzgerald are at the battle.  Hugh Glass is wounded.
